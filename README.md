# SOC Incident Reports

This repository contains **realistic, end-to-end SOC incident investigations**
based on alerts generated in my lab environments (Wazuh, Suricata, cloud logs).

Each case demonstrates how I work as a SOC analyst:
- Alert triage and validation
- Evidence collection and correlation
- Timeline reconstruction
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping
- Clear written communication for escalation and reporting

These reports are written to mirror **Tier 1–2 SOC workflows** and
incident documentation used in operational security teams.
